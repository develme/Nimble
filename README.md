## Nimble - A NodeJS Framework

Nimble is a web application stack that puts the feeling of enjoyment and accomplishment back into developing. Nimble encompasses common tasks used in the majority of web applications, making the process of going from development to production a painless one. All of this, without sacrificing functionality within your projects.

Sound a lot like [Laravel](http://www.laravel.com)? We are huge fans of the aforementioned PHP framework! In fact, if it makes more sense to use PHP instead of NodeJS, we recommend taking advantage of the cool features Laravel has to offer.

## Documentation

The framework currently does not have any documentation.
